what is the difference between spring api and spring boot api?
Spring is a popular framework for building Java applications. It provides a wide range of features and components for building enterprise-grade applications. Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of creating and deploying standalone, production-ready Spring-based applications.

Spring API and Spring Boot API both use the same underlying Spring framework. The main difference between them is in how they are used to build applications. 

Spring API provides a set of components and tools that can be used to build complex, scalable, and high-performance applications. It includes a wide range of modules such as Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, and more. Spring API requires a fair amount of configuration and setup to use, which can sometimes be time-consuming.

On the other hand, Spring Boot API provides an opinionated approach to building applications. It includes an embedded Tomcat or Jetty server, auto-configuration of Spring beans, and other features that make it easy to create standalone, production-ready Spring applications. Spring Boot API reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to get started with Spring and enables developers to focus on building business logic.

In summary, Spring API is more flexible and customizable, while Spring Boot API provides a more opinionated and streamlined approach to building Spring applications. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the development team.

what is Spring boot architecture? 
Spring Boot is a Java-based open-source framework for building and deploying stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration. It is built on top of the Spring framework and provides a set of pre-built components and tools to help developers quickly and easily build and deploy applications.

The architecture of Spring Boot is based on a few key components:

1. Spring Boot Starters: These are a set of pre-built templates that contain all the necessary dependencies and configurations for building different types of applications. Starters simplify the configuration process and allow developers to focus on writing business logic instead of worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

2. Spring Boot Auto-Configuration: This feature automatically configures the Spring application based on the dependencies added to the project. It scans the classpath and detects the necessary configurations needed for each dependency, reducing the amount of manual configuration required.

3. Spring Boot Actuator: This is a set of built-in tools and endpoints that provide insight into the application's health, performance, and behavior. Actuator provides a variety of features, including monitoring, health checks, and metrics, which can help developers to better understand and manage their application.

4. Spring Boot DevTools: This feature provides a set of tools that can help developers to speed up the development process. It includes features such as automatic application restarts, live reloading of resources, and remote debugging.

5. Spring Boot CLI: This is a command-line interface that allows developers to quickly create, test, and run Spring Boot applications. It provides a set of commands for generating, testing, and deploying applications, making it easy to get started with Spring Boot.

Overall, the architecture of Spring Boot is designed to simplify and accelerate the development of Spring-based applications. It provides a set of pre-built components and tools that help developers to quickly and easily build and deploy applications, while also providing the flexibility to customize and extend the framework as needed.

@SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features

@EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
@ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
@Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes


we use the @ComponentScan annotation along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. @ComponentScan without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.baeldung.componentscan.springapp")
 the @ComponentScan annotation can also scan, detect, and register beans for classes annotated with @Component, @Controller, @Service, and @Repository.

Disabling Specific Auto-configuration Classes

@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})

If the class is not on the classpath, you can use the excludeName attribute of the annotation and specify the fully qualified name instead. Finally, you can also control the list of auto-configuration classes to exclude by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.


 @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation enables Spring Boot to auto-configure the application context. Therefore, it automatically creates and registers beans based on both the included jar files in the classpath and the beans defined by us.
 @EnableAutoConfiguration feature tries to automatically configure your Spring application based upon the JAR dependency you have added in the classpath.
 For example, if HSQLDB is on your classpath, and you have not manually configured any database connection beans, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.
