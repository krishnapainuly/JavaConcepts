Goldman Sachs Tech Interview Questions on Data Structures and Algorithms 

You have a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5]..
Find the contiguous subarray within an array, A of length N, which has the largest sum.
What is a linked list, and what are its types? 
Can doubly-linked be implemented using a single pointer variable in every node? 
Given a list of nonnegative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number. For example:  Given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
How will you implement a queue using a stack? 
Can you check if a given Binary Tree is BST or not? 
Given a positive integer n and a string s consisting only of letters D or I, you have to find any permutation of the first n positive integer that satisfies the given input string. D means the next number is smaller, while I means the next number is greater. Note that the length of given string s will always equal to n - 1, and the solution should be in linear time and space. 
Which data structures are used for the BFS and DFS of a graph?

Write the algorithm for a given list of transactions between friends who have to give or take some amount of money from one another. They have to settle up with a minimum number of transactions, and you have to return a list of all the transactions. If B owes A Rs. 200 : B->A = 200. Similarly, if C owes B Rs. 200 : C->B= 200. So the minimum number of transactions is 1, and that should be: C->A = Rs. 200.
