What is compile time polymorphism?
When a polymorphic call is made, and the compiler knows which function is to be called; this is known as compile-time polymorphism. The features like function default arguments, overloading  support compile-time polymorphism.

25. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details.
Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:

1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object.

2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class

28. What is data abstraction?
Data abstraction is a very important feature of OOPs that allows displaying only the important information and hiding the implementation details. For example, while riding a bike, you know that if you raise the accelerator, the speed will increase, but you donâ€™t know how it actually happens. This is data abstraction as the implementation details are hidden from the rider.

29. How to achieve data abstraction?
Data abstraction can be achieved through:
Abstract class
Abstract method

What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple definitions can be given to a single interface. For example, if you have a class named Vehicle, it can have a method named speed but you cannot define it because different vehicles have different speed. This method will be defined in the subclasses with different definitions for different vehicles.
